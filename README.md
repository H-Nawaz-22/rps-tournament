Drexel University ECE 105 Spring 2019: Final Assignment

For the final assignment of ECE 105, students were asked to design a rock, paper, scissors bot.
Specifically, students were to write a function that returns a move based on the opponents move history.
The bots of all of the class's students competed against each other to determine their grade for their assignment.
